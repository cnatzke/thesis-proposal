	abstract = {The two-photon decay of the first excited 0+ state of 16O has been measured using the Heidelberg-Darmstadt crystal ball. A branching ratio of Γγγ Γtot = (6.6±0.5) · 10-4 was obtained. As in the cases of 40Ca and 90Zr previously reported by us, the 2γ decay of 16O proceeds via double E1 and M1 transitions of similar strength; the evidence is the observed interference term in the 2γ angular correlation. The ratio of the matrix elements αE1 χ for 16O was restricted to the two inverse values (-6.2±1.5) or (-0.16±0.04). An interpretation of 2γ matrix elements observed for 16O, 40Ca and 90Zr in terms of the electric polarizabilities and magnetic susceptibility is given leading to a qualitative understanding of this decay mode. © 1987.},

	abstract = {Gamma-Ray Infrastructure For Fundamental Investigations of Nuclei (GRIFFIN) is a new high-efficiency \${\textbackslash}gamma\$-ray spectrometer designed for use in decay spectroscopy experiments with low-energy radioactive ion beams provided by TRIUMF's Isotope Separator and Accelerator (ISAC-I) facility. The high-efficiency GRIFFIN array comprises 16 Compton-suppressed large-volume HPGe clovers, and is designed to be used with a suite of ancillary detectors, providing a powerful and versatile tool for studying exotic nuclei. The structures of \$N = 82\$ nuclei below doubly-magic \${\textasciicircum}\{132\}\$Sn are crucial for calculations of the astrophysical r-process as these isotopes form `waiting-points' that play an important role in the formation and shape of the second \$r\$-process abundance peak. Many of the most neutron-rich \$N = 82\$ nuclei are, however, out of reach to the current generation of radioactive beam facilities and their properties must be predicted. In the past, shell-model calculations for the half-lives of these nuclei have been performed by adjusting the quenching of the Gamow-Teller (GT) operator in order to reproduce the half-life of \${\textasciicircum}\{130\}\$Cd. However, the calculated half-lives of the nuclei below \${\textasciicircum}\{130\}\$Cd are known to be systematically too large. A recent measurement of the \${\textasciicircum}\{130\}\$Cd half-life with EURICA indicated a shorter half-life of \${\textasciicircum}\{130\}\$Cd, which would lead to a re-scaling of the GT quenching by a constant factor for all nuclei in the region and potentially resolves the discrepancy. However, the reduced quenching of the GT operator implied by these results creates a new discrepancy in the calculated half-life of the \$N=82\$ isotope \${\textasciicircum}\{131\}\$In. Half-life measurements of nuclei in this region are complicated due to the presence of \${\textbackslash}beta\$-decaying isomers with comparable half-lives and large \${\textbackslash}beta n\$ branches, making \${\textbackslash}gamma\$-ray photo-peak gating with a high-resolution, high-efficiency, \${\textbackslash}gamma\$-ray spectrometer an ideal method to measure each of the isomeric half-lives. In this work, measurements of the half-lives of the \${\textasciicircum}\{128-130\}\$Cd isotopes were performed. The half-life of the \$N=82\$ \$r\$-process waiting point nucleus \${\textasciicircum}\{130\}\$Cd was measured to be 126(4){\textasciitilde}ms confirming the EURICA measurements and in strong disagreement with the earlier measurements of 162(7){\textasciitilde}ms and 195(35){\textasciitilde}ms. A detailed data set for the \${\textbackslash}beta\$ and \${\textbackslash}beta n\$ decay of \${\textasciicircum}\{131\}\$In was also analyzed. The \${\textbackslash}beta\$ decay from the single proton hole nucleus \${\textasciicircum}\{131\}\$In to the single neutron hole nucleus \${\textasciicircum}\{131\}\$Sn is of current interest with respect to advancing our understanding of nuclear forces and shell evolution in this region, including modelling the astrophysical \$r\$-process. In this work, three different \${\textbackslash}beta\$ decaying states in \${\textasciicircum}\{131\}\$In were studied in detail, providing new information about the shell structure of \${\textasciicircum}\{131\}\$Sn. The half-lives of these three \${\textbackslash}beta\$ decaying states of \${\textasciicircum}\{131\}\$In measured in this work agree with the previous measurements. The half-life of each \${\textbackslash}beta\$ decaying state of \${\textasciicircum}\{131\}\$In is significantly longer than the half-life predicted from shell-model calculations.},

We examine the results of laboratory experiments that have provided initial constraints on the nuclear symmetry energy and on its density dependence at and somewhat below normal nuclear matter density. Even though some of these constraints have been derived from properties of nuclei while others have been derived from the nuclear response to electroweak and hadronic probes, within experimental uncertainties-they are consistent with each other. We also examine the most frequently used theoretical models that predict the symmetry energy and its slope parameter.

As in the cases of 40Ca and 90Zr previously reported by us, the 2γ decay of 16O proceeds via double E1 and M1 transitions of similar strength; the evidence is the observed interference term in the 2γ angular correlation. The ratio of the matrix elements αE1 χ for 16O was restricted to the two inverse values (-6.2±1.5) or (-0.16±0.04). An interpretation of 2γ matrix elements observed for 16O, 40Ca and 90Zr in terms of the electric polarizabilities and magnetic susceptibility is given leading to a qualitative understanding of this decay mode. © 1987.},

              Second-order processes in physics is a research topic focusing attention from several fields worldwide including, for example, non-linear quantum electrodynamics with high-power lasers, neutrinoless double-
              β
              decay, and stimulated atomic two-photon transitions. For the electromagnetic nuclear interaction, the observation of the competitive double-
              γ
              decay from
              137m
              Ba has opened up the nuclear structure field for detailed investigation of second-order processes through the manifestation of off-diagonal nuclear polarisability. Here, we confirm this observation with an 8.7
              σ
              significance, and an improved value on the double-photon versus single-photon branching ratio as 2.62 × 10
              −6
              (30). Our results, however, contradict the conclusions from the original experiment, where the decay was interpreted to be dominated by a quadrupole-quadrupole component. Here, we find a substantial enhancement in the energy distribution consistent with a dominating octupole-dipole character and a rather small quadrupole-quadrupole component in the decay, hindered due to an evolution of the internal nuclear structure. The implied strongly hindered double-photon branching in
              137m
              Ba opens up the possibility of the double-photon branching as a feasible tool for nuclear-structure studies on off-diagonal polarisability in nuclei where this hindrance is not present.},
