As in the cases of 40Ca and 90Zr previously reported by us, the 2γ decay of 16O proceeds via double E1 and M1 transitions of similar strength; the evidence is the observed interference term in the 2γ angular correlation. The ratio of the matrix elements αE1 χ for 16O was restricted to the two inverse values (-6.2±1.5) or (-0.16±0.04). An interpretation of 2γ matrix elements observed for 16O, 40Ca and 90Zr in terms of the electric polarizabilities and magnetic susceptibility is given leading to a qualitative understanding of this decay mode. © 1987.},

We compare them to novel coupled-cluster calculations based on different chiral two- A nd three-nucleon interactions, for which a strong correlation between the charge radius and dipole polarizability is observed, similar to the stable nucleus Ca48.

Its determination is a key objective of contemporary nuclear physics, with consequences for the understanding of dense matter within neutron stars. We examine the results of laboratory experiments that have provided initial constraints on the nuclear symmetry energy and on its density dependence at and somewhat below normal nuclear matter density. Even though some of these constraints have been derived from properties of nuclei while others have been derived from the nuclear response to electroweak and hadronic probes, within experimental uncertainties-they are consistent with each other. We also examine the most frequently used theoretical models that predict the symmetry energy and its slope parameter. By comparing existing constraints on the symmetry pressure to theories, we demonstrate how contributions of three-body forces, which are essential ingredients in neutron matter models, can be determined. © 2012 American Physical Society.},

              Second-order processes in physics is a research topic focusing attention from several fields worldwide including, for example, non-linear quantum electrodynamics with high-power lasers, neutrinoless double-
              β
              decay, and stimulated atomic two-photon transitions. For the electromagnetic nuclear interaction, the observation of the competitive double-

              decay from
              137m
              Ba has opened up the nuclear structure field for detailed investigation of second-order processes through the manifestation of off-diagonal nuclear polarisability. Here, we confirm this observation with an 8.7
              σ
              significance, and an improved value on the double-photon versus single-photon branching ratio as 2.62 × 10
              −6
              (30). Our results, however, contradict the conclusions from the original experiment, where the decay was interpreted to be dominated by a quadrupole-quadrupole component. Here, we find a substantial enhancement in the energy distribution consistent with a dominating octupole-dipole character and a rather small quadrupole-quadrupole component in the decay, hindered due to an evolution of the internal nuclear structure. The implied strongly hindered double-photon branching in
              137m
              Ba opens up the possibility of the double-photon branching as a feasible tool for nuclear-structure studies on off-diagonal polarisability in nuclei where this hindrance is not present.},
