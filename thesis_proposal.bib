  abstract = {The two-photon decay of the first excited 0+ state of 16O has been measured using the Heidelberg-Darmstadt crystal ball. A branching ratio of Γγγ Γtot = (6.6±0.5) · 10-4 was obtained. As in the cases of 40Ca and 90Zr previously reported by us, the 2γ decay of 16O proceeds via double E1 and M1 transitions of similar strength; the evidence is the observed interference term in the 2γ angular correlation. The ratio of the matrix elements αE1 χ for 16O was restricted to the two inverse values (-6.2±1.5) or (-0.16±0.04). An interpretation of 2γ matrix elements observed for 16O, 40Ca and 90Zr in terms of the electric polarizabilities and magnetic susceptibility is given leading to a qualitative understanding of this decay mode. © 1987.},

Since this is the only short-lived isotope for which the dipole polarizability αD has been measured, the combination of these observables provides a benchmark for nuclear structure theory. We compare them to novel coupled-cluster calculations based on different chiral two- A nd three-nucleon interactions, for which a strong correlation between the charge radius and dipole polarizability is observed, similar to the stable nucleus Ca48. Three-particle-three-hole correlations in coupled-cluster theory substantially improve the description of the experimental data, which allows to constrain the neutron radius and neutron skin of Ni68.},

Its determination is a key objective of contemporary nuclear physics, with consequences for the understanding of dense matter within neutron stars. We examine the results of laboratory experiments that have provided initial constraints on the nuclear symmetry energy and on its density dependence at and somewhat below normal nuclear matter density. Even though some of these constraints have been derived from properties of nuclei while others have been derived from the nuclear response to electroweak and hadronic probes, within experimental uncertainties-they are consistent with each other. We also examine the most frequently used theoretical models that predict the symmetry energy and its slope parameter. By comparing existing constraints on the symmetry pressure to theories, we demonstrate how contributions of three-body forces, which are essential ingredients in neutron matter models, can be determined. © 2012 American Physical Society.},

Here, we find a substantial enhancement in the energy distribution consistent with a dominating octupole-dipole character and a rather small quadrupole-quadrupole component in the decay, hindered due to an evolution of the internal nuclear structure. The implied strongly hindered double-photon branching in

  abstract = {Gamma-gamma angular correlation measurements are a powerful tool for identifying the angular momentum (spin) of excited nuclear states involved in a γ-ray cascade, and for measuring the multipole orders and mixing ratios of transitions. Though the physical angular correlations are fully calculable from ﬁrst principles, experimental eﬀects can make the extraction of coeﬃcients and thus conclusions about spins and mixing ratios diﬃcult. In this article we present data analysis techniques developed for the clover detectors of the GRIFFIN spectrometer at TRIUMF-ISAC combined with GEANT4 simulations in order to extract accurate experimental results.},

The core samples, with 70–100 g weight, have cylindrical geometry and are sealed such that radon gas from 238U decay would not escape from the sample. For room background subtraction, pure quartz samples identical to core samples were used. The sample is first counted with the HPGe detector to identify the elements through its characteristics gamma rays. Then the elemental concentration is determined by counting the sample with a NaI detector. In order to determine the absolute concentrations, the sample activity is compared with the activities of standards supplied by NIST and IAEA. The concentration of 238U and 232Th has been determined in ppm range with that of 40K in wt.\%.},

Combining measurements of internal conversion electrons, γ rays, γ-conversion electron and γ-γ coincidences, a detailed level scheme was constructed involving 280 transitions between 137 excited states. Gamma-gamma angular correlations were measured to assign spins and determine mixing ratios, δ, for transitions of mixed multipolarities. These mixing ratios, together with the measured internal conversion coefficients, α, allowed the electric monopole, E0, components of several Jπ → Jπ transitions to be determined. The lowest Jπ = 3− state was firmly identified for the first time in the neutron deficient Hg isotopes, and several new structures with possible “K = 0”, “K = 2” and “K = 4” bandheads also proposed. These results provide new insights into the mixing of shape coexisting structures in 188Hg.},

  abstract   = {The 80Ge structure was investigated in a high-statistics β-decay experiment of 80Ga using the GRIFFIN spectrometer at TRIUMF-ISAC through γ, β−e, e−γ, and γ−γ spectroscopy. No evidence was found for the recently reported 0+2 639-keV level suggested as evidence for low-energy shape coexistence in 80Ge. Large-scale shell model calculations performed in 78,80,82Ge place the 0+2 level in 80Ge at 2 MeV. The new experimental evidence combined with shell model predictions indicate that low-energy shape coexistence is not present in 80Ge.},

  abstract = {A high-precision branching ratio measurement for the superallowed Fermi β+ emitter 62Ga was performed with the Gamma-Ray Infrastructure for Fundamental Investigations of Nuclei (GRIFFIN) spectrometer at the Isotope Separator and Accelerator (ISAC) radioactive ion beam facility at TRIUMF. The high efficiency of the GRIFFIN spectrometer allowed 63 γ-ray transitions, with intensities down to ≈1 part per million (ppm) per 62Gaβ+ decay, to be placed in the level scheme of the daughter nucleus 62Zn, establishing the superallowed β branching ratio for 62Ga decay to be 99.8577+0.0023−0.0029\%, a factor of 4 more precise than the previous world average. For several cascades, γ−γ angular correlation measurements were performed to assign spins and/or determine the mixing ratios of transitions. In particular, the spin of the 2.342 MeV excited state in the daughter nucleus 62Zn was definitively assigned as J=0. This assignment resolves a discrepancy between previous measurements and has important implications for the isospin symmetry breaking correction, δC1, in 62Ga superallowed Fermi β decay.},

  abstract = {The β− decay of 47K to 47Ca is an appropriate mechanism for benchmarking interactions spanning the sd and pf shells, but current knowledge of the β−-decay scheme is limited. We have performed a high-resolution, high-efficiency study of the β− decay of 47K with the GRIFFIN spectrometer at TRIUMF-ISAC. The study revealed 48 new transitions, a more precise value for the 47K half-life [17.38(3) s], and new spin and parity assignments for 8 excited states. Levels placed for the first time here raise the highest state observed in β− decay to within 568(3) keV of the Q value and confirm the previously measured large β−-decay branching ratios to the low-lying states. Previously unobserved β− feeding to 3/2+ states between 4.5 and 6.1 MeV excitation energy was identified with a total β−-feeding intensity of 1.29(2)\%. The sum of the B(GT) values for these states indicates that the 1s1/2 proton hole strength near this excitation energy is comparable to the previously known 1s1/2 proton and neutron hole strengths near 2.6 MeV.},
